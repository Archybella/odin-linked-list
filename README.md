- `Node.js`: Contains the implementation of the Node class.
- `example-usage.js`: Provides an example usage of the LinkedList class.

## Usage

To use the linked list, you can include `LinkedList.js` and `Node.js` in your project. See `example-usage.js` for an example of how to use the LinkedList class.

## Functions

- `append(value)`: Adds a new node containing value to the end of the list.
- `prepend(value)`: Adds a new node containing value to the start of the list.
